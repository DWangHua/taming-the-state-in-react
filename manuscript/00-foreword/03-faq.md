## FAQ

**How to get updates?** I have two channels where I share updates about my content. Either you can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share qualitative content. You will never receive any spam. Once you get the update that the book has changed, you can download the new version of it.

**How to get access to the source code projects and screencasts series?** If you have bought one of the extended packages that give you access to the source code projects and screencast series, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you have bought the course somewhere else than on [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com/) course platform, you need to create an account on this platform, go to the Admin page and reach out to me with one of the email templates. Afterward I can enroll you to the course. If you haven't bought one of the extended packages, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the source code projects and screencast series.

**Why is the book not for free?** I often share content for free ([blog](https://www.robinwieruch.de/), [ebook](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/)). I believe information should be free and everyone should be able to learn from it. However, at some point I think people are able to be professionals in these areas and can afford to pay for the more advanced content. Whereas learning React is an entry point to a whole ecosystem and to first professional opportunities, Redux and MobX are advanced solutions that are used in larger applications most often in companies. At this point, it makes sense to pay for educating to keep up with the industry standards.

**What should I do when I cannot afford to pay for the book?** If you cannot afford the book but want to learn about the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are still a student or that the book would be too expensive in your country. In addition, I want to support any cause to improve the diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**How to support the project?** If you believe in the content that I create, you can [support me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/). Furthermore, I would be grateful if you spread the word about this book after you read it and enjoyed reading it. Furthermore, I would love to have you as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**Is there a money back guarantee?** Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please reach out to me to get a refund.

**Can I help to improve the content?** Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can simply open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/taming-the-state-in-react). These can be improvements technical wise yet also about the written word. I am no native speaker that's why any help is appreciated. You can open pull requests on the GitHub page as well.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading the book. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. After all, helping others can internalize your learnings, too. If there is no one out to help you, you can always reach out to me.

**Why does it use React to teach about state?** Nowadays, state management is often used in modern applications. These applications are built with solutions like React, Angular and Vue. In order to teach about state management, it makes sense to apply it in a real world context such as React. I picked React, because it has only a slim API and a good learning curve. It is only the view layer with local state management. You can learn about it in one of my other books: [the Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/). However, you don't necessarily need to apply your learnings about state management in React. You can apply these learnings in your Angular, Vue or React Native application, too.

**What is the ratio between learning Redux and MobX?** Even though MobX becomes more of a popular alternative to Redux, the book teaches you more about Redux than MobX. However, in the future I want to extend the content and depending on the popularities adjust the chapters.

**What's your motivation behind the book?** I want to teach about this topic in a consistent way. You often find material online that doesn't receive any updates or only teaches a small part of a topic. When you learn something new, people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to give you this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. In addition, I hope I can support minorities with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). In addition, in the recent time, I found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming. It's a meaningful activity for me that I prefer over any other 9 to 5 job at any company. That's why I hope to pursue this path in the future.
